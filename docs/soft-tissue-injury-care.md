# Climber’s soft tissue care
 
> Based on the [The Climbing Bible: Managing Injuries](https://www.adventurebooks.com/products/the-climbing-bible-managing-injuries) by Stian Christophersen

In soft tissues, acute injuries are injuries that happen suddenly, usually from a specific event like a fall, awkward landing, or pulling too hard on a hold.

When we refer to acute injuries on soft tissues it means that they affect muscles, tendons, or ligaments. 

## The RICE method

The RICE method was developed in 1978 by the doctor Gabe Mirkin to help reduce the inflammation symptoms and support recovery.

**RICE** stands for:

- **Rest**: give your body a break and avoid using the injured area.  
- **Ice**: apply ice in the injured area to reduce pain and swelling.  
- **Compression**: wrap the affected area to keep swelling under control.  
- **Elevate**: keep the injured area above your heart to reduce pain, throbbing and swelling. .

But after years, they found out that resting with placing cold to the injured area, actually can have a negative effect.

## What Is Inflammation?

The symptoms are:

- Redness  
- Swelling with heat  
- Pain  

However, it’s a mistake to think swelling is the same as inflammation, because swelling can be just the buildup of waste from inflammation that the body hasn’t cleared out yet.  

And the best way to reduce swelling is to keep the muscle active.

## PEACE & LOVE method

That’s why another framework was created after RICE,  called **PEACE** and **LOVE**.

### PEACE: for the first days after the injury

- **P - Protect**  
  Avoid making the injury worse. Don’t stop using the injured part completely, but limit its use.

- **E - Elevate**  
  Keep the injured area raised above heart level to reduce swelling.

- **A - Avoid anti-inflammatories**  
  Don’t take anti-inflammatory medications in the early phase, even if they reduce pain, as they may slow down the recovery.

- **C - Compress**  
  Use bandages or compression wraps to control swelling around the injured area.

- **E - Educate**  
  Due to the huge amount of information you can find online, consider learning about your injury and the best ways to care of it with the help of a health professional.

### LOVE: for after the acute phase

- **L - Load**  
  Gradually reintroduce movement and weight to the injured area, without overdoing it.

- **O - Optimism**  
  Keep a positive mindset, as your attitude can influence the recovery.

- **V - Vascularisation**  
  Stay active and keep training the parts of your body that are not injured to maintain good overall fitness.

- **E - Exercise**  
  Do targeted exercises to restore mobility and strength.
