## Definitions 

!!! example "Definitions"
    - **RE (Repetition effort)**: number of repetitions performed relative to the maximum possible. For example, an RE of 8 (out of 12) means 8 repetitions were completed when 12 could have been done, leaving 4 reps in reserve.

    - **%1RM (Percentage of one repetition maximum)**: percentage of the maximum weight a person can lift once with proper technique.

    - **Velocity loss**: Reduction in execution speed during a set, expressed as a percentage.
    
## Repetitions

These guidelines help adjust your training load according to whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced climber.
