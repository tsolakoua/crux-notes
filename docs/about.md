# About 

## What's inside

- Climbing knowledge from trusted resources.
- Stories and reviews from fellow climbers who want to share their journeys and experience.

## The goal

To find something useful or at least relatable, regardless of your climbing experience. We often have access to great climbing books, videos, and expert advice. However, in reality, we either forget what we learn or donâ€™t have the time to search for it again. Crux Notes is here to bring everything together in one single place, like a climbing notebook.

## Open source

This is an open source project. Feel free to [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/tsolakoua/cruxnotes.git) if you want!
