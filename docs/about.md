# About 

> This website contains climbing tips based on climbing books and other official resources.

## The goal

To find something useful or at least relatable, regardless of your climbing experience. We often have access to great climbing books, videos, and expert advice. However, in reality, we either forget what we learn or donâ€™t have the time to search for it again. Crux Notes is here to bring everything together in one single place, like a climbing notebook.
