# Intermittent hangs

> _Based on_ _[The science of climbing training: An evidence-based guide to improving your climbing performance](https://sergioconsuegra.com/)_ _by Sergio Consuegra._

Intermittent hangs are a great way to build finger strength. They involve short hangs with quick rests in between, and can be adjusted depending on your level and goals.

Below are a few evidence based protocols you can try:

## Protocols 

| Author                     | Sets × Hangs | Hang : Rest | Rest between sets | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Eva López (2017)**         | 3–5 × 4–5    | 10s : 5s                 | 1 min             | Focus on endurance. High intensity without full recovery.                                   |
| **Anderson Brothers (2014)** | 9 × 6        | 10s : 5s (or 7s : 3s)    | 3 min             | Each set on a different grip on the board. For less advanced (10:5) or advanced climbers (7:3). Requires 30–40 min warm-up. 70h rest between sessions. |
| **Eric Hörst (2016)**        | 2–5 × 3      | 7s : 53s                 | 5 min             | High intensity protocol. Use maximum grip depth, if possible minimum of 14mm. Effort 9–9.5/10 without reaching failure. Combines strength & endurance.                  |
