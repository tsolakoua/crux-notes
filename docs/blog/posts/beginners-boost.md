# What boosted my climbing as a beginner

In this article I would like to share with you what helped me improve my climbing drastically.

I started climbing seriously in 2023 and I loved it, but I felt I had no idea what I was doing. Just trying to complete the boulders. I remember sometimes my body was feeling super tight and tired with all the effort I was making but without understanding what moves I was doing. I am sure we have all been there as beginner climbers. 

Since I am a person that likes to know what does and why, I decided to take a one hour class at my local gym and it really changed my climbing.

After the warm-up, the teacher asked me to try a couple of easy boulders to see how I climb. He immediately noticed that I could do the climbs, but not with proper technique.

Then we spent the next hour learning the following techniques:

- **Drop knee**: a technique where you turn one knee inward and drop it down, rotating your hips toward the wall to extend your reach and reduce strain on your arms.

- **Flagging**: using one foot that is not stepping on any foothold as a counterbalance to reach to the next hold or avoid barn door.

- **Rockover**: a weight-shifting technique where you step onto a foothold and move your center of gravity directly above it by bringing your hips over the foot.

Honestly, I felt I was so bad at them during the class, especially the drop knee. It didn’t feel natural at all. But learning what these techniques are was only the beginning. I spent the next month (or more) practicing them on easy boulders consistently. Again and again. That’s what really made the difference.

So there are a few things that helped me improve:

- Learn the techniques — either by taking a class, asking your friends, or looking for online resources.
- Practice and consistency are key.
- Repeat climbs to apply techniques if you think you can perform them smoother.

All in all, knowing what you are doing and climbing mindfully, not only can make you a better climber, but it will also make you enjoy more your sessions!
