Just trying to complete the boulders. I remember sometimes my body was feeling super tight and tired with all the effort I was making but without understanding what moves I was doing. I am sure we have all been there as beginner climbers. </p> <p>Since I am a person that likes to know what does and why, I decided to take a one hour class at my local gym and it really changed my climbing.</p> <p>After the warm-up, the teacher asked me to try a couple of easy boulders to see how I climb. He immediately noticed that I could do the climbs, but not with proper technique.</p> <p>Then we spent the next hour learning the following techniques:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Drop knee: a technique where you turn one knee inward and drop it down, rotating your hips toward the wall to extend your reach and reduce strain on your arms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flagging: using one foot that is not stepping on any foothold as a counterbalance to reach to the next hold or avoid barn door</p> </li> <li> <p>Rockover: a weight-shifting technique where you step onto a foothold and move your center of gravity directly above it by bringing your hips over the foot,</p> </li> </ul> <p>Honestly, I felt I was so bad at them during the class, especially the drop knee. It didn\u2019t feel natural at all. But learning what these techniques are was only the beginning. I spent the next month (or more) practicing them on easy boulders consistently. Again and again. That\u2019s what really made the difference.</p> <p>So there are a few things that helped me improve:</p> <ul> <li>Learn the techniques \u2014 either by taking a class, asking your friends, or looking for online resources</li> <li>Practice and consistency are the key</li> <li>Repeat climbs to apply techniques if you think you can perform them smoother</li> </ul> <p>All in all, knowing what you are doing and climbing mindfully, not only can make you a better climber, but it will also make you enjoy more your sessions!</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
